- [🚀 App](api/app): The `App` type represents your Fiber application.
- [📎 Bind](api/bind): Binds the request and response items to a struct.
- [📋 Constants](api/constants): Core HTTP constants used throughout Fiber.
- [🧠 Ctx](api/ctx): The Ctx interface represents the Context which holds the HTTP request and response. It has methods for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.
- [📦 Fiber](api/fiber): Fiber represents the fiber package where you start to create an instance.
- [🎣 Hooks](api/hooks): Fiber lets you run custom callbacks at specific points in the routing lifecycle. Available hooks include:
- [📃 Log](api/log): Fiber's built-in log package
- [🔄 Redirect](api/redirect): Fiber's built-in redirect package
- [🧩 Services](api/services): Services wrap external dependencies. Register them in the application's state, and Fiber starts and stops them automatically—useful during development and testing.
- [🗂️ State Management](api/state): State management provides a global key–value store for application dependencies and runtime data. The store is shared across the entire application and persists between requests. It's commonly used to store Services, which you can retrieve with the GetService or MustGetService functions.
- [🍳 Examples](client/examples): Client usage examples.
- [🎣 Hooks](client/hooks): Hooks are used to manipulate the request/response process of the Fiber client.
- [📤 Request](client/request): Request methods of Gofiber HTTP client.
- [📥 Response](client/response): Response methods of Gofiber HTTP client.
- [🖥️ REST](client/rest): HTTP client for Fiber.
- [📊 Benchmarks](extra/benchmarks): These benchmarks aim to compare the performance of Fiber and other web frameworks.
- [🤔 FAQ](extra/faq): Frequently asked questions. Open an issue if you have another question to add.
- [🏗️ Internal Architecture](extra/internal): Learn about the internal architecture of Fiber, including the overall structure, request handling flow, routing, and path parsing.
- [📚 Learning Resources](extra/learning-resources): Interactive learning platforms and community resources to help you learn Fiber concepts through hands-on practice.
- [🐛 Advanced Format](guide/advance-format): Learn how to use MessagePack (MsgPack) and CBOR for efficient binary serialization in Fiber applications.
- [🐛 Error Handling](guide/error-handling): Fiber supports centralized error handling: handlers return errors so you can log them or send a custom HTTP response to the client.
- [🔬 Extractors](guide/extractors): Learn how to use extractors in Fiber middleware
- [⚡ Make Fiber Faster](guide/faster-fiber): Custom JSON Encoder/Decoder
- [🧠 Go Context](guide/go-context): Learn how Fiber's Ctx integrates with Go's context.Context, how to interact with the underlying fasthttp RequestCtx, and how to use the available context helpers.
- [🎭 Grouping](guide/grouping): Grouping works like Express.js. Groups are virtual; routes are flattened with the group's prefix and executed in declaration order, mirroring Express.js.
- [🔄 Reverse Proxy Configuration](guide/reverse-proxy): Learn how to set up reverse proxies like Nginx or Traefik to enable modern HTTP capabilities in your Fiber application, including HTTP/2 and  HTTP/3 (QUIC) support. This guide also covers basic reverse proxy configuration and links to external documentation.
- [🔌 Routing](guide/routing): Routing refers to how an application's endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.
- [📝 Templates](guide/templates): Fiber supports server-side template engines.
- [🧰 Utils](guide/utils): Generics
- [🔎 Validation](guide/validation): Validator package
- [Adaptor](middleware/adaptor): The adaptor package converts between Fiber and net/http, letting you reuse handlers, middleware, and requests across both frameworks.
- [BasicAuth](middleware/basicauth): Basic Authentication middleware for Fiber that provides HTTP basic auth. It calls the next handler for valid credentials and returns 401 Unauthorized for missing or invalid credentials, 400 Bad Request for malformed Authorization headers, or 431 Request Header Fields Too Large when the header exceeds size limits. Credentials may omit Base64 padding as permitted by RFC 7235's token68 syntax.
- [Cache](middleware/cache): Cache middleware for Fiber that intercepts responses and stores the body, Content-Type, and status code under a key derived from the request path and method. Special thanks to @codemicro for contributing this middleware to Fiber core.
- [Compress](middleware/compress): Compression middleware for Fiber that automatically compresses responses with gzip, deflate, brotli, or zstd based on the client's Accept-Encoding header.
- [CORS](middleware/cors): CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware for Fiber lets servers control who can access resources and how. It isn't a security feature; it merely relaxes the browser's same-origin policy so cross-origin requests can succeed. Learn more on MDN.
- [CSRF](middleware/csrf): The CSRF middleware protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks by validating tokens on unsafe HTTP methods such as POST, PUT, and DELETE. It responds with 403 Forbidden when validation fails.
- [EarlyData](middleware/earlydata): The Early Data middleware adds TLS 1.3 "0-RTT" support to Fiber. When the client and server share a PSK, TLS 1.3 lets the client send data with the first flight and skip the initial round trip.
- [Encrypt Cookie](middleware/encryptcookie): The Encrypt Cookie middleware for Fiber encrypts cookie values for secure storage.
- [EnvVar](middleware/envvar): EnvVar middleware for Fiber exposes environment variables with configurable options.
- [ETag](middleware/etag): ETag middleware for Fiber that helps caches validate responses and saves bandwidth by avoiding full retransmits when content is unchanged.
- [ExpVar](middleware/expvar): The ExpVar middleware exposes runtime variables over HTTP in JSON. Using it (e.g., app.Use(expvarmw.New())) registers handlers on /debug/vars.
- [Favicon](middleware/favicon): Favicon middleware for Fiber that drops repeated /favicon.ico requests or serves a cached icon from memory. Mount it before your logger to suppress noisy requests and avoid disk reads.
- [Health Check](middleware/healthcheck): Middleware that adds liveness, readiness, and startup probes to Fiber apps. It provides a generic handler you can mount on any route, with constants for the conventional /livez, /readyz, and /startupz endpoints.
- [Helmet](middleware/helmet): Helmet secures your app by adding common security headers.
- [Idempotency](middleware/idempotency): The Idempotency middleware helps build fault-tolerant APIs. Duplicate requests—such as retries after network issues—won't trigger the same action twice on the server.
- [KeyAuth](middleware/keyauth): The KeyAuth middleware implements API key authentication.
- [Limiter](middleware/limiter): The Limiter middleware for Fiber throttles repeated requests to public APIs or endpoints such as password resets. It's also useful for API clients, web crawlers, or other tasks that need rate limiting.
- [Logger](middleware/logger): Logger middleware for Fiber that logs HTTP requests and responses.
- [Pprof](middleware/pprof): Pprof middleware exposes runtime profiling data for analysis with the Go pprof tool. Importing it registers handlers under /debug/pprof/.
- [Proxy](middleware/proxy): The Proxy middleware forwards requests to one or more upstream servers.
- [Recover](middleware/recover): The Recover middleware for Fiber intercepts panics and forwards them to the central ErrorHandler.
- [Redirect](middleware/redirect): Redirect middleware maps old URLs to new ones using simple rules.
- [RequestID](middleware/requestid): The RequestID middleware generates or propagates a request identifier, adding it to the response headers and request context.
- [ResponseTime](middleware/responsetime): Response time middleware for Fiber that measures the time spent handling a request and exposes it via a response header.
- [Rewrite](middleware/rewrite): The Rewrite middleware remaps the request path using custom rules, helping with backward compatibility and cleaner URLs.
- [Session](middleware/session): The Session middleware adds session management to Fiber apps through the Storage package, which offers a unified interface for multiple databases. By default, sessions live in memory, but you can plug in any storage backend.
- [Skip](middleware/skip): The Skip middleware wraps a handler and bypasses it when the predicate returns true for the current request.
- [Static](middleware/static): The Static middleware serves assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript.
- [Timeout](middleware/timeout): The timeout middleware enforces a deadline on handler execution. It wraps handlers with
- [Route Handlers](partials/routing/route-handlers): Registers a route bound to a specific HTTP method.
